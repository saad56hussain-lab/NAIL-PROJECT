            <p class="p1">
                Nail art is a creative and expressive form of art that involves painting, decorating, and enhancing fingernails and toenails to improve their appearance. It is usually performed after basic nail care procedures such as manicures and pedicures, which include trimming, shaping, cleaning, and polishing the nails. These beauty treatments also help in maintaining nail hygiene by removing cuticles and softening the skin around the nails, making them healthier and more attractive.</p>
<p class="p2">
    Over the years, nail art has evolved from simple nail polishing to a highly skilled form of self-expression. With the advancement of cosmetic products and modern nail techniques such as gel nails, acrylic nails, and dipping powder, nail art has become more detailed, long-lasting, and innovative. The nail-care industry has experienced rapid growth due to changing fashion trends and increased interest in personal grooming and beauty care.</p>

It allows individuals, especially teenagers and adults, to express their personality, creativity, and emotions through various colors, patterns, shapes, and designs.

Designs such as floral patterns, geometric shapes, abstract art, festive themes, and character-based art are widely popular among different age groups.</p>
